- [x] **Remove unnecessary UI** - Removed info/pause buttons from top-right
- [x] **Track darts per turn visually** - Dart icons and hit/miss indicators
- [x] **Persistent state after every dart** - Real-time state updates
- [x] **Game resume functionality** - Full history-based resume system
- [x] **Consistent app look and feel** - Matches existing theme and design patterns

### Implementation Quality
- [x] **Clear, incremental phases** - 6 distinct development phases
- [x] **Git commits after each phase** - Well-documented commit history
- [x] **Comprehensive tests** - Full test coverage for all game logic
- [x] **Modern Flutter best practices** - Clean code, proper state management

### Technical Features Implemented

#### UI/UX Enhancements
